    <h2>Early life and traning</h2>
    <p>Pusarla Venkata Sindhu was born and brought up in Hyderabad, India to P. V. Ramana and P. Vijaya.Ramana, an employee of the Indian Railways, was born in Nirmal, Telangana while Vijaya hails from Vijayawada, Andhra Pradesh.Both her parents have been national level volleyball players. Her father, Ramana, who was a member of the Indian volleyball team that won the bronze medal in 1986 Seoul Asian Games, received the Arjuna Award in 2000 for his contribution to the sports.

        Sindhu lives in Hyderabad, Telangana. She was educated at Auxilium High School, Hyderabad and at St. Ann's College for Women, Hyderabad.Though her parents played professional volleyball, she chose badminton over it because she drew inspiration from the success of Pullela Gopichand, the 2001 All England Open Badminton Champion. She eventually started playing badminton from the age of eight. She first learned the basics of the sport with the guidance of Mehboob Ali at the badminton courts of Indian Railway Institute of Signal Engineering and Telecommunications in Secunderabad. Soon after, she joined Pullela Gopichand's Gopichand Badminton Academy.While profiling her career, a correspondent with The Hindu wrote:
            <br>
            "The fact that she reports on time at the coaching camps daily, traveling a distance of 56 km from her residence, is perhaps a reflection of her willingness to complete her desire to be a good badminton player with the required hard work and commitment."
